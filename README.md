For test model additionally, I selected a dataset from Kaggle:  
url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yiyanghao/sushidataset

This test showed that despite the fact that the final dataset was expanded, the models increased the number of layers and the optimal number of epochs was selected, in some complex pictures the model gave the wrong result, in the future it is possible to select several different datasets, further increasing the training set.
